        <p>Alexis Price is a woman of many talents. Her current role as an energetic and creative teacher at an alternative high school, allows her to help students navigate English language challenges and inspire their learning. Her background as an ESL/ENL specialist and department head have opened the door for her to serve a multitude of students and lead her team effectively. Driven by a passion for growth and community impact, she envisions a future of stepping into an administrative role down the line, specifically that of an assistant principal. In addition to her career aspirations, Alexis dreams of achieving a doctorate degree. “Call me Dr. Price,” she jokes.</p>
            
        <p>Beyond her teaching career, Alexis’s hands-on hobbies reflect her inventive spirit. She finds joy in baking, loving the challenge of new recipes and the reward of a delicious treat at the end. “It’s a beautiful way to share love and comfort with others.” Her creativity extends to crafting, where she pushes herself to think outside the box. “Crafting is another way to share love with others, who doesn’t love a nice hand-made gift?” She also enjoys recharging her batteries by taking long, scenic walks outdoors.</p>

        <p>Alexis’s appreciation for meaningful connections shines through her values, as she believes strongly in a society where everyone should earn a fair wage and can live with dignity. As a mother, she is inspired to build a better world for her young daughter. Her beloved American Foxhound, Maybelle, often joins her on life’s adventures. One day soon she hopes to “fly the coop to Porto, Portugal. It’s been almost a decade since I visited and it calls to me.” A unique place to visit with her family to be sure.</p>

        <p>Alexis has big dreams, a huge servant’s heart, and enough tenacity to overcome any obstacle. Welcome to the team!</p>
