        <p class="intro">
            I was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Growing up, I enjoyed spending time listening and playing music, drawing, and riding my bike around the neighborhood. I lived in California for three years in my early life. I moved to Tennessee when I was 10 and have lived here ever since.
        </p>

            As a child, I was always curious and loved to learn new things. I spent countless hours reading books and creating things with my hands. This passion for knowledge led me to pursue a career in design and communication, where I could apply my skills and creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy various hobbies, including playing drums, spending time outdoors, and painting. I also like to stay active with strength training and running. I am currently training for a 5K race in November, a 10K race in March, and an 8 mile race in June.
        </p>

        <p>
            My wife and I have been together for nine years, and have been married for three. We also have a young daughter born in 2023.
            <span class="sentence">I am grateful for their unwavering support.</span>
